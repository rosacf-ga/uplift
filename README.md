# **Uplift**
Uplift is a full CRUD application that serves as a one-stop mental health resource page. Once users log in, they are able to search for different mental health programs and services, and are able to narrow their search by filtering out programs by state. 

Additionally, logged in users can leave reviews for any program on the page, create a new program, and edit or delete any program they created.
